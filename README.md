# masters-project-ids

This is a Python 3 application-layer IDS for the AWS cloud environment. 

It is part of the artefact for Andrew Swan's 2021 Masters' Project at the Robert Gordon University. 

This IDS gets logs from webapp instances by pcap file download and processes these logs to feed into
the Machine Learning models for anomaly detection, based on prior dataset of normative dataflow.
